## Approach

I wanted to create an interesting portfolio page that could show all the projects that I have worked on.

I decided to go for a look and feel of an 90' operating system, I did this by using old style fonts and icons.

## Logic:

## Challenges & lessons learnt

one of my biggest challanges was recreating the logic after working out that the way I was originally creating it was not ideal as it was blowing up to 500 lines of code.

## Still to do...
