## Approach

I wanted to create an interesting portfolio page that could show all the projects that I have worked on.

I decided to go for a look and feel of a 90's operating system, I did this by using old style fonts and icons.

## Challenges & lessons learnt

As this was my first React application my challanges was working with state and understanding how it works, especially when my previous application was about working with the dom.

My other challanges faced when working with external custom components was styling them with CSS.

## Still to do...

- create a double click feature for the icons
- make it mobile responsive
